• Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag rice varieties were used.
• The dataset (1) has 75K images including 15K pieces from each rice variety. The dataset (2) has 12 morphological, 4 shape and 90 color features.
• ANN, DNN and CNN models were used to classify rice varieties.
• Classified with an accuracy rate of 100% through the CNN model created.
• The models used achieved successful results in the classification of rice varieties.
